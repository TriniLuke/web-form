# web-form

This web registration form will was created to brush up on my skills with form validation.
Form validation was done using Constraint Validation JS and some regular JavaScript to get this form to validate properly.
Validating the confirm password is not too hard but doing it using the Constraints API was difficult. However, I was able to figure it out and I now have a good understanding of how to do it.
